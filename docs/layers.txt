When designing a Data Warehouse (DWH) for Business Intelligence (BI), data is typically structured in multiple layers to ensure better organization, data quality, and performance. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of each layer:

1. **Base Layer (Raw Layer / Staging Layer)**
   - **Purpose**: Stores raw data as it is extracted from source systems (e.g., ERP, CRM, POS).
   - **Characteristics**:
     - No transformations applied.
     - Only used for temporary storage.
     - Data may be stored in flat files, external tables, or raw relational tables.
   - **Example**: A table holding all transactions from the retail POS system without any filtering or cleaning.

2. **Cleansing Layer (Data Quality Layer)**
   - **Purpose**: Standardizes and cleanses data for consistency and correctness.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Handles deduplication, missing values, standardizing formats (e.g., date formats, currency conversions).
     - Applies business rules for validation (e.g., customer age should be >18).
     - Ensures referential integrity (e.g., foreign keys match valid primary keys).
   - **Example**: Removing duplicate customer records and standardizing product names.

3. **Business Layer (Transform Layer / Operational Data Store - ODS)**
   - **Purpose**: Applies business logic and transformations to prepare data for analysis.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Joins data from multiple sources.
     - Applies calculations like profit margins, revenue growth, customer segmentation.
     - Prepares data for reporting but is not yet optimized for performance.
   - **Example**: Creating a "Sales Fact" table that calculates net sales after discounts.

4. **Intermediate Layer (Aggregated Layer / Performance Optimization Layer)**
   - **Purpose**: Optimizes data for faster query performance.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Stores pre-aggregated or summarized data to improve BI tool performance.
     - Creates indexed and partitioned tables for faster lookups.
     - Denormalized for quick access in dashboards.
   - **Example**: Instead of storing daily sales transactions, an aggregated table with total sales per store per month.

5. **Mart Layer (BI Layer / Presentation Layer)**
   - **Purpose**: Provides data in a user-friendly format for reporting and visualization.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Organized in **star schema** or **snowflake schema** for BI tools like Power BI.
     - Designed for specific business use cases (e.g., a "Sales Mart" for sales dashboards, "Customer Mart" for CRM analysis).
     - Filters and organizes data in a way that makes sense for end users.
   - **Example**: A Power BI dataset that provides ready-to-use sales KPIs for executives.

Summary of Differences:
-------------------------------------------------
| Layer           | Purpose                 | Key Features                                     |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Base (Raw)      | Stores raw data         | No transformations, exact copy of source data   |
| Cleansing       | Standardizes & cleans   | Deduplication, missing values handling          |
| Business        | Applies business rules  | Joins, calculations, logic-based transformations|
| Intermediate    | Optimizes performance   | Pre-aggregations, indexing, partitioning        |
| Mart           | Presentation & reporting| BI-friendly schema, filtered for analysis       |

Each layer ensures that data is reliable, performant, and usable for business intelligence needs.
